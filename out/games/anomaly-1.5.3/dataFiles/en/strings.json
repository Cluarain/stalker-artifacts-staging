This quality of theirs and their appearance make them perfect gemstones and jewellers all over the world strive to have them in stock. \r\n\t\t\nThe usefulness of the artefact, however, is not limited to its industrial applications. There is scientific evidence suggesting that sapphire-like stones effectively protect from psy-waves, whereas the outer shell slightly increases resistance to toxicity.\r\n\t\t\nHowever, it can cause objects in its vicinity to heat up and in extreme cases to ignite along with the artefact. For this reason, it is safe to conclude that it absorbs heat and is able to convey it to other objects.\r\n\t\t\nDue to its density the weight of artefact has increased beyond normal standards, and thus it is one of the heaviest anomalous creations in the Zone.\r\n\t\t\n \nRadiation output is low on the artefact radiation scale.",

  "ui_inv_burn_protection": "Burn Resistance\n \n%c[ui_gray_1]Burn Resistance is primarily a measure of your ability to withstand thermal anomalies, as well as survive encounters with pyrokinetic mutants. Thermal anomalies come in several forms: they can manifest as a hemisphere of thermal radiation, slowly cooking anything that steps into them. They can manifest as shimmering waves of air that erupt into powerful jets of flame, and they can even manifest as mobile comets. It is not unusual for two or more of these variants to manifest together: for instance, the bridge tunnel leading to Yantar from Wild Territory consists of both the comet and eruption variants.\n \nThe eruption variant, colloquially known as a \"Burner\", is several hundred degrees Celsius, and some forms are powerful enough to instantly roast their hapless victims, regardless of their protection. In the north of the Zone, a Burner variant known as the \"Boiler\" operates on the same principles, but utilizes superheated gushes of steam instead of flame.\n \nIt is rumoured that thermal anomalies give birth to some of the more powerful artefacts of the Zone, but the dangers are so great, even with proper protection, that most choose to steer clear of them.\n \n%c[d_orange]How Much Protection Do You Need?\n%c[ui_gray_1]Important: The percentage values suggested below refer only to how full the Burn Resistance bar appears, which is determined predominantly by armour.

In the Zone, these materials are most often found in the form of chemical anomalies, the most common of which being the infamous \"Burnt Fuzz\", a moss or vine-like entity that releases thousands of sharp, toxic spores at the hapless stalker who runs into it. Other forms of chemical anomalies include gas clouds that cover entire areas, slime puddles that rot whatever steps in them, or even miniature acidic fog banks that react explosively to metal or organic matter.\n \nAll of these excel at eating exposed skin or devouring exposed respiratory systems.

The degree to which you are irradiated by these particles is measured in milisieverts, or mSv.

However, Radiation Resistance is preventative, not reductive: it does not reduce the damage done by radiation already accrued. If you decide to run naked through the Nuclear Power Plant and acquire 3000 mSv as a result, putting on a gas mask won't do much to save you at that point. Radiation Resistance also does not reduce the radiation accrued through ingesting Zone meats, nor do they block the radiation emitted by artefacts.\n \n%c[ui_gray_1]In these cases, you'll need to rely on medicine or other consumables to flush your system instead.

If you're carrying more than 50% of your total weight capacity, you may notice your recovery slow slightly. This effect becomes more noticeable as you approach maximum capacity. If you're carrying above your maximum capacity, all actions that drain stamina - including walking - will begin draining it significantly faster.\n%c[d_cyan] •%c[ui_gray_1] Equip higher quality backpacks, or wear armours that grant more carrying capacity than they take up, to let yourself carry more equipment without impacting your stamina recovery.\n%c[d_cyan] •%c[ui_gray_1] Unless specially modified, most gas masks make breathing a hot and sweaty affair.
