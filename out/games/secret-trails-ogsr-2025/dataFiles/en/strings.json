  "af_armor_4": "Controller's Scalp",
  "enc_zone_artifact_armor_4": "This absolute reduces damage from aggressive chemical environments, adds health and screens psi-emission very well! Another quite useful quality of the absolute is that in a person wearing it on the belt, the skin structure changes. It, without losing elasticity, coarsens. As a result, resistance to gunshot wounds increases. A negative property is an increase in the need for food.",
  "af_simbion": "Symbiont",
  "enc_zone_artifact_simbion": "The unique Symbiont modificat is obtained by joint transmutation of four artifacts at once in the Fruit Punch anomaly. Jellyfish, Droplet, Stone Blood and Thorn, converted into a single whole, give a person wearing it on the belt quite significant screening from psi-emission and protection from radiation.

The Mentor, like all of us, is sure that He again presented us, His followers, a gift to strengthen our faith! After a skirmish with a squad of military guarding scientists, phalanx leader Ostakh brought a 'Shell' with bodies and trophies. Together with the bodies of the misguided, it was sacrificed to His Flame. But Watchers Brother Akim and Brother Lekho discovered the 'Shell' falling out of the 'Burner' after six hours. It glowed unusually, which confirmed the Watchers in His sign. This changed 'Shell' went through two skirmishes together with naturalist Brother Roman. On the way back, his phalanx encountered and accepted battle with four burers in the catacombs. Brother Roman claims that this changed 'Shell' worked miracles � Brother Roman almost didn't feel the psi-attacks of the burers! Besides this, the artifact somehow removed a large portion of radiation that Brother Roman received. He also noticed that all the time he wore this artifact, he didn't want to eat. Truly, He gives us particles of Eternity even now! Further experiments showed that this artifact, which received the name 'Controller's Scalp' from the Qualitet, improves well-being and saves from chemical burns.

  "amk_recipt_souls_text": "... anyway, it was like this: On the night of July seventh, half a month ago. In short, in building #3 a 'Connecting Rod' surfaced - a wandering 'Burner' anomaly, damn it. I remained alone in this building. Max and Yurka Sevastopol left, although how - I still don't get it... we drank heavily. Just as I gathered to make a bed in the corner � opa! Fire from the wall! I was drunk and at first thought that Timur Marinade fixed the found infantry flamethrower and is pranking with it. Then thought that a gas pipe burst in the walls, there was a kitchen behind the wall once. Then remembered that gas here, in the pipes, ran out fifteen years ago. Got confused a little, started pouring water. But when I saw the flame moving along the wall, I realized, but it was too late. I managed to rip my HK G36 off the nail, but not the bag with the 'Soul' found two days ago. I was very upset, drank. And four hours later my 'Soul' falls out of the fire! Only glows funny, like a lamp. Well, I grabbed it and into the container. Woke up in the morning, look: the guys are roasting a boar on the 'Burner'. \n\nHere I immediately remembered about the 'Soul'. Warned Max, and trudged to the eggheads. Getting there was fun. Well, that's another story. Got there, gave this 'Soul' for measurements. Sakhar scratched his bald head for a long time after them. \"The artifact, besides improving human health,\" - he says, - \"has gained the ability to reduce radiation dose\". Also, this art (I named it 'Soul Drop', sounds cool) adds fatigue. Sakhar tried to persuade me to sell it for a long time, but I didn't buy it. I already had a plan born by that time: throw this art into the 'Burner' one more time and see what happens, and then bring it to Sakhar for measurements again. He scratched his skull for a long time again, but agreed. I took my 'Soul Drop' and moved to the tunnel. There are tons of these 'Burners' there. Threw it, waiting. After six hours it started to appear, but wouldn't jump out of the anomaly. Barely got it out, got singed. Almost became as bald as Sakhar. Brought it for measurement and turned out right! This art (I named it 'Fiery Soul') began to protect from radiation twice as well! No, I shouldn't have skipped entering the institute. I'd be a professor, an academician there... \n\nAnyway, I went to the 'Burner' for the third time, like, damn, the Old Man to the blue sea. On the way dropped a couple of zombies. One turned out to be former Mikha Cameroon. I drank for his peace later. What a fate, bitch! Just a month ago I drank with him, and today a bullet in the head... may the earth be... I threw the 'Fiery Soul' into the 'Burner' and started waiting again. Only very long. It jumped out only after 10 hours (good thing I didn't have to poke into the anomaly this time). I managed to take a nap during this time... Glows so joyfully. I picked up the art and moved to the eggheads. There's already a whole brigade on alert there, feeding me coffee with cognac, fussing with the artifact themselves. I came up with a name for it under the secular mood with coffee and Hennessy � 'Crystal Soul'. The eggheads are gasping there, admiring, saying that this hyp... hyperdif... anyway, 'Crystal Soul' both improves health and received some unprecedented indicator for radiation protection. In the morning I easily got to the 'Burner' again. Threw my precious 'Crystal Soul' into the anomaly. \n\nWaited long. Look - the art jumped out. I didn't understand anything, the glow didn't change a damn bit. Well, I think, to hell with you, if you don't want to - don't. Started walking back, look � a wandering 'Electro' is coming in the passage. No way to pass. I sat, sat, then I think: \"Let me throw my art into the 'Electro'\"! Turned out like in the 'Burner' � it disappeared there and jumped back out in just an hour. The light coming off is completely different! I waited for the 'Electro' to migrate further, and went my way. Brought the 'Crystal Soul' to Yantar, gave it to Sakhar. He was gone for a long time. Comes out of the lab, eyes glowing behind glasses, really like a psycho. Says it's some kind of absolute.

I only recognized him by the stupid bandana � red, with hammer-and-sickle emblems. And only four hours since we parted, he went ahead, and I waited for Vadik Rosy to pass the package. Shame, damn... Well, anyway, I put on a gas mask and climbed to pull him out. Couldn't understand for a long time how he fell there, after all, he's been trampling the Zone for the fourth year, until I saw that someone snapped his neck. I, plainly, immediately changed my mind about burying him in the ground. Who knows what hostess prepared canned food from an experienced stalker for herself. And whether this very hostess is grazing somewhere nearby. Quickly looted him, trying not to touch the clothes, took off the backpack, arts from the belt. Didn't take his favorite TOZ, 'Fruit Punch' ate the gun significantly. And bailed from there quickly. Vanka had only three arts: 'Droplet', 'Urchin' and these 'Grandmother's Beads' of his. 'Droplet' and 'Urchin' were dangling on his belt at the back. But 'Grandmother's Beads' landed in the 'Fruit Punch'. Thought the artifact was done for, but turned out the art is intact, only glows weirdly. Well, while I got to Freedom guys, I tested it. It became different. I called it 'Great Grandmother's Beads' to myself. Stops bleeding on the count of one. This, what's it called, raises tone. Saved from bullets nicely when I ran into a military zombie.

The unpleasant side of the 'Snotty Porcupine' is that it increases human sensitivity to electric shock, and it is uncomfortable to wear due to the constantly oozing incomprehensible mucus.
